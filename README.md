URL Shortener On Rails

Implemented Users, Urls as models
Added click counter on urls_controller.
Struggled with AJAX before realizing we
didn't need it for the click counter.

A next feature might be to add a count of clicks
next to each url on the urls#index view and have it
update with an AJAXified partial. Some advice on that
is welcome.

Used minitest, so some feedback on that would
be welcome. Will possibly convert all the minitest
to Rspec later.
